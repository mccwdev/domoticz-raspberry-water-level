# Raspberry Pi

Measure water level with a Raspberry Pi and a JSN-SR04T ultra-sonic distance sensor and send data to Domoticz.

I have put the distance sensor in the top of the tank so it measure the distance to the water. If the distance is 0 the
tank is full, and if the tank is empty this script will return the height of the tank.
